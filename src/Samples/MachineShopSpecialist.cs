     *  a capacity. A workshop has *n* machines. A stream of jobs
     *  (enough to  keep the machines busy) arrives. Each machine
     *  breaks down periodically. Repairs are carried out by two
     *  repairman: Jack and John that vary in their efficiency with
     *  different machine brands. The workshop works continuously.
